The results look OK but the problem is that they never go over -50. The values are also important to us if the signals are stronger than -50dBm...<br /><br />2. retrieving Wlan.WlanBssEntry.rssi. According to the documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms706839(VS.85).aspx) it looks very nice, exactly what we needed. But the values are too low to be realistic. For instance, the RSSI value of an AP placed a few meters away from my laptop is -139... My question is how I should interpret these values? I couldn't see any correlation...<br /><br />Could anyone help me? Thanks a lot in advance!<br />",
