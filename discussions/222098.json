Keeping in mind that Scan() is asynchronous in its nature, I've started with copy/pasting the ConnectSynchronously() with all its event handling code and adjusting it appropriately.</p>\r\n<p>Scanning works perfectly, but unfortunately no events are ever detected, so the re-scan always ends with a timeout, even if it set as big as 20 sec.</p>\r\n<p>What may be missing? I refrain from posting a big piece of code here now, but can do it if necessary...</p>",
