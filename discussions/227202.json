Can you help me about it?</p>\r\n<p>My system in also win7 with VS2010 .net4.0. I disabled ethernet, disconneted WIFI and then run the code.<br>My code lists all the wifi, also set up the profile correctly (the profile is shown in win7 also) but when try to connect, it stops at code &quot;case Wlan.WlanNotificationCodeAcm.ScanFail:&quot; in function: OnWlanNotification.<br>&nbsp;<br>Question: 1) do i need to disable win7 wifi management? 2) if i don't have to disable win7 wifi management, when my code connects to wifi successfully, does the win7 wifi status show connected also? 3) can anyone send me some working sample code or do you also have any problems when you try to connect to wifi?</p>\r\n<p>many thanks!</p>",
