There has to be a way to get the MAC from both of them however this is what I am getting: \r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWlan.WlanAvailableNetwork[] ntwks = selectedInterface.GetAvailableNetworkList(Wlan.WlanGetAvailableNetworkFlags.IncludeAllAdhocProfiles);\r<br />\n<br />\nWlan.WlanBssEntry[] wlanBssEntries = selectedInterface.GetNetworkBssList();\r<br />\n<br />\nUsing the SSID if I foreach both can be incorrect as two or more can have the same name i.e. &quot;linksys&quot;. I need to use the mac to join on. However it only seems to exist in the wlanBssEntries as BitConverter.ToString(wlanBssEntry.dot11Bssid)\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there something I am missing? I would like to get  n.dot11DefaultAuthAlgorithm and dot11DefaultCipherAlgorithm for the networks in wlanBssEntries by an unique Id like the MAC. I was thinking of using the name and signal strength or something similar.<br />\n",
