However this time I'm attempting to run a test application that utilizes the DLL on Win Server 2008.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The application is a WPF app that is being deployed to clients, but we occasionally will pull it up on the server to check a few of the reports.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, it's working for all clients. But anytime it's brought up on the server it crashes with this error:</p>\r\n<p>Framework Version: v4.0.30319Description: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.</p>\r\n<p>Exception Info: System.DllNotFoundExceptionStack:&nbsp; &nbsp;at NativeWifi.Wlan.WlanCloseHandle(IntPtr, IntPtr)&nbsp; &nbsp;at NativeWifi.WlanClient.Finalize()</p>\r\n<p>I've tried catching and handling the error, but it seems to be&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;somewhere within the DLL and it's not being forwarded to my application. Anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this issue? I&quot;m guessing there's a required DLL that's\r\n missing in Server 2008 R2.</p>\r\n",
