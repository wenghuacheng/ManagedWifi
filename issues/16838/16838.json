    "Description": "I was able to override and use this function in Windows XP 32-bit, Vista 32-bit, Vista 64-bit, and Windows 7 32-bit.  I cannot seem to get it to function in Windows 7 64-bit.  I am using PEAP MS-CHAPv2 User Properties standard from MSDN and only seem to run into the issue with Windows 7 64-bit.  Has anyone had a similar issue?",
