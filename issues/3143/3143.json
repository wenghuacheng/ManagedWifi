    "Description": "Implement scanning for available networks.\nÂ \nSupport snippet:\n---\nYes, that's true - GetProfiles is not the right way to go. You should use WlanClient's Scan method. The clumsy thing about Scan is that it's asynchronous: it returns immediately, and then you should get an event (you can subscribe to one of WlanClient's events, not sure which...) and only once you get the ScanComplete notification code, only then you can call WlanGetAvailableNetworkList...\n \n- but guess what, I didn't include this method yet. So maybe it isn't ready for version 1.0 yet ...\n \nI'll try to cover this basic feature (scanning) ASAP.",
